    <h1>Types of Sauna</h1>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Traditional Finnish Sauna</h2>
        <p>The most common sauna type, using a wood stove or electric heater to heat stones. The heat is dry, with
            temperatures ranging from 70°C to 100°C (158°F to 212°F). Water can be poured on the stones to create steam
            (known as löyly).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Infrared Sauna</h2>
        <p>Uses infrared heaters to emit light that is absorbed by the skin, heating the body directly rather than the
            air. This type operates at lower temperatures (typically between 45°C and 60°C or 113°F to 140°F) and
            provides a more gentle heat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Steam Sauna (Turkish Bath or Hammam)</h2>
        <p>In a steam sauna, water is heated to produce steam that fills the room, creating a humid environment. The
            temperature is usually lower, around 40°C to 50°C (104°F to 122°F), with high humidity (100%). It’s ideal
            for improving circulation and skin health.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Wet Sauna</h2>
        <p>A mix between the traditional sauna and steam room, it involves both heat and steam. It's designed for high
            humidity but with dry heat. People often pour water on hot stones to increase humidity levels.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Infrared Light Sauna</h2>
        <p>This sauna uses a combination of infrared light and heat to promote relaxation and healing. It operates at a
            lower temperature than traditional saunas but provides targeted heat that helps relieve muscle tension and
            detoxify the body.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Salt Sauna</h2>
        <p>Similar to a traditional sauna, but with salt-lined walls. The heat combined with salt inhalation is said to
            promote respiratory health and skin rejuvenation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Bio Sauna</h2>
        <p>A hybrid of the Finnish sauna and steam sauna, the bio sauna uses a lower temperature (50°C to 60°C or 122°F
            to 140°F) and higher humidity than the Finnish sauna. It's often used for a gentler sauna experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Russian Banya</h2>
        <p>A traditional Russian sauna that’s similar to the Finnish sauna but includes the use of a venik (a bundle of
            twigs) for gentle tapping, which is believed to enhance circulation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Wooden Sauna</h2>
        <p>Similar to the Finnish sauna, but often designed for outdoor use. It’s constructed entirely of wood, adding
            an organic aesthetic to the experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sauna-type">
        <h2>Portable Sauna</h2>
        <p>Smaller and more affordable, portable saunas use infrared or steam technology and are typically made for
            personal use at home. They can be set up quickly and packed away after use.</p>
